A powerful DSL for creating bike workouts that can be compiled to ERG and other workout formats.
Files written in {name} should be easy to read,
while being concise.

== Example

.Basic Example
[source]
----
"Warm up" 5m at 75% FTP / 60% FTHR
  @0m "5 minute warmup!"
> "Get your legs spinning with a 5 minute warm up."

"Work" 10m at 100% FTP / 100% FTHR
  @0m "10 minutes of 100% FTP to get going!"
  @1m "Make sure you're in a good cadence."
  @9:00 "Finish strong!"
----

== Status

{name} is in a pre-beta state.  This means that there are still rough edges,
and syntax may be tweaked without warning.

Once {name} is in beta, the language will be stable and conform to semantic versioning,
so minor versions will be backwards compatible.
