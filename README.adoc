A powerful DSL for creating bike workouts that can be compiled to ERG and other workout formats.
Files written in {name} should be easy to read,
while being concise.

== Status

{name} is in a pre-beta state.  This means that there are still rough edges,
and syntax may be tweaked without warning.

Once {name} is in beta, the language will be stable and conform to semantic versioning,
so minor versions will be backwards compatible.
