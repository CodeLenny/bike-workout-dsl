== Equation

+++
<div railroad-of="Equation"></div>
+++

A numeric equation to use for values.
Sub-equations can be surrounded in parenthesis.

Order of operations must be explicit with parenthesis,
e.g. `2 * (5 * 10)`.  Invalid: `2 * 5 * 10`.

Values may be {Numbers}, {Strings}, {Variables}, sub-equations,
or the combination of sub-equations with an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `\/`).

Addition can be used to combine strings and numbers:
any addition that involves a string and a number will be cast to a string: `2 + "5"` will produce `"25"`.
No other operation other than addition can be used with strings.
